# 2. Machine Learning for Regression

## 2.1 Car Price Prediction Project

- Data for the project is avaiable [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv).

## 2.2 Data Preparation

- After read-in the data, the next step would be data cleaning. For example, checking any inconsistent representation of data in the columns or rows.

## 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis

- One of the most important steps of machine learning is EDA. In this step we try to understand the data by looking at the distribution, handling missing values, removing unwanted varaibles
- In this step we observe values of the data, handle missing values, categorize the values (categorical, continuous, discrete), find the data distribution (skewness, kurtosis), identify the relationships (correlations, causation), find the outliers in the data.

## 2.4 Setting Up the Validation Framework

- In this step we split the data into three subsets: trian, validation, and test sets.
- Generally, we split 60% data for training, 20% for validation and 20% for test.
- Training data is used to training the model, validation data for model evaluation and test data helps to find the final accuracy of the model.
